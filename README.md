## Saves Microsoft Stream videos for offline enjoyment

Alpha-quality, don't expect much. It does work though, so that's a neat feature.

It's slow (e.g. a 60-min video takes 20-30 minutes to download). Not much i can do about it for now unless i find a better way than ripping HLS.

## This project is now looking for contributors
<img src="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-github-to-follow.jpg" width=400 />

Roadmap -
- [ ] Token cache (so you don't have to log in every time you run destreamer) **Work in progress on the tokencache branch**
- [ ] Download closed captions if available
- [ ] Performance improvements (via aria2c maybe?)
- [ ] Single static binary (for each major OS)

Send a quality PR first and i'll add you as a contributor to the repository.

## DISCLAIMER

Hopefully this doesn't break the end user agreement for Microsoft Stream. Since we're simply saving the HLS stream to disk as if we were a browser, this does not abuse the streaming endpoints. However i take no responsibility if either Microsoft or your Office 365 admins request a chat with you in a small white room.


## PREREQS

* **Node.js**: anything above v8.0 seems to work. A GitHub Action runs tests on all major Node versions on every commit.
* **youtube-dl**: https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html, you'll need a fairly recent version that understands encrypted HLS streams. This needs to be in your $PATH. Destreamer calls `youtube-dl` with a bunch of arguments.
* **ffmpeg**: a recent version (year 2019 or above), in `$PATH`.

Destreamer takes a [honeybadger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg) approach towards the OS it's running on, tested on Windows, macOS and Linux, results may vary, feel free to open an issue if trouble arise.

## USAGE

# Make sure you use the right escape char for your shell if using line breaks (as this example shows).
# For PowerShell your escape char is the backtick (`) instead of backslash (\), for cmd.exe use caret (^).

$ node destreamer.js --username username@example.com \
    --personcode "10694432" --pass "YourPolimiPassword" \ 
    --outputDirectory "videos" \
    --videoUrls "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" \
                "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-2" \
                "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-3"
```

You can create a `.txt` file containing your video URLs, one video per line. The text file can have any name, followed by the `.txt` extension. Run destreamer as follows:
```
$ node destreamer.js --username username@example.com --outputDirectory "videos" \
    --videoUrls list.txt
```

**DO NOT RUN IN AN ELEVATED SHELL ON WINDOWS**, not going to work, Chromium will keep crashing.

Passing `--username` is optional. It's there to make logging in faster (the username field will be populated automatically on the login form).

Passing `--personcode` and `--pass` are optional. They are there to make logging in polimi.it authenticator faster (the personcode and password field will be populated automatically on the login form).

> :warining: **filling `--pass` without filling `--personcode` do nothing** 

You can use an absolute path for `--outputDirectory`, for example `/mnt/videos`.

To choose preferred video format and quality you can use the `-f` (`--format`) option. It exposes a native [`youtube-dl` parameter][4].
If you do not pass this parameter then `youtube-dl` will download the best available quality for each video.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
For now you need to keep the puppeteer browser window open (the one that pops up for logging in) if you download more than one video in one go.

Also, just ignore this error, we already have what we need to start the download, no time to deal with collaterals -

The video is now saved under `videos/`, or whatever the `outputDirectory` const points to.
